Chatbot Description
===================

This chatbot teaches you about KPOP, and in particular, the boyband BTS. My chatbot will also chat with you about anything, if it knows it. Its main features include:  

1. Matching keywords to a response so that if you type, “teach me something” or “will you teach me something”, it will match teach and respond with “Ask me about kpop” or something similar. The response is a random entry from that specific keywords directory. 

2. Transposing responses, so if you type, “I am a cat”, or something similar with the keyword “I am”, it will respond with “why are you a cat”, or something similar. 

3. Another feature it has is the ability to store inputs to be used in later responses. For example, if you type “I am worried about my studies”, then later type, “I am angry”, the chatbot will respond with “Do you think your anger is because of your studies?”. The chatbot will store the whole string containing worried since this is one of its keywords and then store anger and replace them depending on whether it is an adjective or noun to be used in the final response. 

4. The chatbot will also remember an input if it matches a keyword in the top of the directory and will repeat the question every once in a while, just to offset the default responses when there is no valid keyword. 

5. The Chatbot knows if the user is repeating themselves and mention it. 

6. The Chatbot takes input regardless of the form i.e. “how are you” and “HOW are YoU” will produce the same response.
